<!-- 
HTML contains elements.
Ex: html, head, body, p, img etc.

Each element consists of two tags - opening tag and closing tag.
Ex: To represent a paragraph - opening tag: <p>, closing tag </p>

Few elements are self closing meaning they don't have separate closing tag. 
Ex: <img src="birds.png" />

Each element can have multiple (supported) attributes - these provide additional info.
Ex: <img src="nature.jpg" width="500" height="600">
Here the src attribute is used to specify the path. width and height are used to specify dimensions.
