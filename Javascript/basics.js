// variables are used to store the value of elements. we can declare variables in three ways
// var - more traditional way (better to avoid this)
// let - modern way - ES5 way - used to declare variables whose can be altered afterwards
// const - modern way - ES5 way - used to declare variables whose cannot be altered afterwards
var a = 1
let b = 2
const c = 3

// operations and operators
let result1 = a + b // addition
let result2 = a - b // substraction
let result3 = a * b // multiplication
let result4 = a / b // division
